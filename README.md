### Key Features:

- **Created using Python and Object-Oriented Programming.**

  - **Normal Mode:**
  - **Wild Mode:** In addition to the regular dice faces, 1s are considered as "wild," allowing more flexibility in bidding and bluffing.
  
- **Player vs Bot**
  - The game supports multiple opponents controlled by bots. These bots make strategic decisions based on probability and game state, creating a challenging and unpredictable experience.
  
- **Bot Behavior**
  - The bot opponents use a variety of strategies based on probability, including evaluating dice probability, raising bids, and calling out "Liar!" at random intervals to keep the game dynamic and challenging.
